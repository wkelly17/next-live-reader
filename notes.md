PWA Notes: Build Folder:  Run 1: JS hashed file name: 
Pages / u / f31fbe6d1cfd7515

Second run: 
[...slug]-bf3be1d570f0d66b;

The content is immutable, and the file names are changing;  

Third run:  Build again with exact same content in u folder:
[...slug]-bf3be1d570f0d66b;  [Same as second run: So these are content based hashes for the sake of the SW cache]. 



Home page is being replaced in cache with every build as well (though the livereader doesn’t seem to have a homepage); 

What if; I cache something; It’s not changed: We don't qanwan
